# Step 1: Prepare HLA allelic sequence database

## Pre-prepared database on GitHub
We provide a [pre-prepared database](IMGTHLA_all_alleles_FINAL.fa) generated from IPD-IMGT/HLA version 3.47 that can be directly used in Step 2. 

Note that this file is uploaded using Git Large File Storage (LFS).

## Building your own database
Alternatively, you can prepare your own database using the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA verison following the [tutorial](tutorial_make_database.ipynb).
